LinkLang (Sphinx extension)
===========================


General information
-------------------

Sphinx [1][2] is a documentation generator. One of the output format is HTML.
Sphinx can also be used as a static website generator [3].

LinkLang Sphinx extension makes it possible to indicate the language of an
external link destination and renders this information in the HTML output
(i.e. includes a "hreflang" attribute [4] in the "a" element [5]).


Installation and Sphinx configuration
-------------------------------------

1. Create a subdirectory called "extensions" in your sphinx project (at the
   same level as the "source" directory).

2. Place the sphinx-linklang source tree in the "extensions" subdirectory.

3. In the conf.py file of your sphinx project, make sure you have lines like:

import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../extensions/sphinx-linklang/src'))

4. In the conf.py file of your sphinx project, make sure "linklang" appears in
   the "extensions" list:

extensions = [
    'linklang'
]


Language indication for an external link destination
----------------------------------------------------

LinkLang Sphinx extension provides the "linklang" role. It can be used to
include an external link. Let's say you want a link to this URL:

http://fictional.server.com

With Sphinx, there are multiple ways of including a link. One of them is to
just include the URL in the input file, another one is to include a link text
and the URL:

`Fictional server <http://fictional.server.com>`_

(Note the angle brackets around the URL, the backticks around the whole link
specification and the trailing underscore.)

You can achieve something equivalent with the "linklang" role:

:linklang:`http://fictional.server.com`

or

:linklang:`Link to fictional server <http://fictional.server.com>`

(Note the absence of trailing underscore.)

If you want to specify that the link destination is in English, then you just
have to prefix the URL with the language code [6] followed by an hyphen.

:linklang:`en-http://fictional.server.com`

or

:linklang:`Link to fictional server <en-http://fictional.server.com>`
